# Project Altis
Project Altis Beta Source, that just works.

# ‚ùì What is Project Altis
Project Altis is a Private Server Aimee around adding a crap ton of new features. We are going to keep up this tradition finishing and polishing up Altis for the community.

### Getting Python 2

The First step to get this Source running is obtaining a version of Python 2. The Python we use is located [here](https://github.com/NormalNed/python) but feel free to use the one in your package manager (should be **python2**)

### Installing Pip

Once you get the Python installed you need to type these following commands to install Pip
```bash
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
python2 get-pip.py
```

### Installing Pip Dependencies
The next part is to get our Dependencies. Open a Terminal inside of the Stride Project and follow these instructions below.
```bash
pip2.7 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installing "our" Panda 3D
We use a version of Astron Panda3D that is upstream code from the main repo. To set it up follow these instructions

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NormalNed/panda3d.git
cd panda3d
python2 makepanda/makepanda.py --everything --installer --no-egl --no-gles --no-gles2 --no-opencv --threads=4
sudo python2 makepanda/installpanda.py
sudo ldconfig
```

### Running the Game
Now run the [Start.sh](Start.sh) file to launch the game.
