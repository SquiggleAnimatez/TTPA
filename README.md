Hey there! Thank you for checking out the README.md of Toontown: Project Anvil!

We are a fanmade, Not-For-Profit recreation of Disney's toontown online

To get started, extract the .zip onto your desktop, download hamachi and follow the instructions a staff member ranked Technical Team+ gives you, and you'll be all set to get connected straight to the toonivers!

Toontown: Project Anvil is built off of the Altis codebase from 2018, currently planned roadmap is to finish Boardbot HQ, add another storyline with more quests, add minibosses, and a new gag track.
