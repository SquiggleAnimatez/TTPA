Hey there! Thank you for checking out the README.md of Toontown: Project Anvil!

We are a fanmade, Not-For-Profit recreation of Disney's toontown online

To get started, extract the .zip onto your desktop, download hamachi and follow the instructions a staff member ranked Technical Team+ gives you, and you'll be all set to get connected straight to the tooniverse!

Toontown: Project Anvil is built off of the Altis codebase from 2018, currently planned roadmap is to finish Boardbot HQ, add another storyline with more quests, add minibosses, and a new gag track.


Known issues

Your internet connection to the servers has been unexpectedly broken
--This means that either your client failed to respond to a heartbeat test (either due to a performance issue or an internet lag spike, or our server had a small hiccup and you were one of the unfortunate few to get donked as a result)

Battle crashes
--Known Causes
-Using over 10 unites per toon in battle will cause the entire room to crash, be it a street, boss battle, building, field office, etc. 10 unites for some reason is the point where it goes from safe, to dangerous as any unites after that have a decently high chance of not only crashing everyone on that room, but the district and possibly the server itself.
-Calling for a friend through the SOS menu has a small chance to crash your game in street battles, if you encounter this crash please contact a technical team member, as this is a rare but still problematic crash and getting those crash logs is important to get the issue resolved.
-If a doodle fails to do peekabo or Jump, all 4 battling toons will be disconnected to prevent a district reset, again, crash logs are nice, but the ones we've gotten and compared are highly inconsistent, and the Technical Team and I are clueless at the moment as to what may be causing the issue.


Boardbot HQ crashes
--If using any SOS cards during a Boardbot Executive Office battle, you will be disconnected to prevent a district reset. again, crash logs are nice, but the ones we've gotten and compared are highly inconsistent, and the Technical Team and I are clueless at the moment as to what may be causing the issue.
--If you use any unites during the V2.0 round in the Chairman battle, you will be disconnected to prevent a district reset. again, crash logs are nice, but the ones we've gotten and compared are highly inconsistent, and the Technical Team and I are clueless at the moment as to what may be causing the issue.
